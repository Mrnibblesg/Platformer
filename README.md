# Platformer
This is my platformer game, written from scratch and purely in Javascript.

...

# How to run
To run, all you need to do is download the files, and run either Main.html for the game, or LevelEditor.html for the level editor.

If you want the game but not the editor, download all of the files that do not have the word editor in them. Here they are in a list:
* Main.html
* Main.js
* Objects.js
* Utilities.js
* Controls.js
* Initialize.js
* Constructors.js

And for the level editor:
* LevelEditor.html
* Utilities.js
* Constructors.js
* Objects.js
* and the file EditorFiles.

# About
This game was started in January of 2018, as a solo Javascript project. It is a project of mine that I started to learn more about Javascript, as well as to get a first feel of developing a large project, and using Github.
